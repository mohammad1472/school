            <p>St. Francis’ College is a recognised, unaided Anglo-Indian minority institution established and administered by “The Catholic Diocese of Lucknow”, a charitable Religious Society registered in Lucknow under the Societies Registration Act XXI of 1860.<br/><br/>
This institution is situated in Hazratganj – the central and posh locality of Lucknow and as such, is very convenient for parents/guardians seeking education for their children. The College has a well-maintained, spacious campus with artistic and imposing buildings, playgrounds and well-grown trees along the boundary, providing an atmosphere for good health and education.<br/><br/>
It is equipped with modern laboratories, spacious classrooms, a well stocked library, gymnasium with a wooden floor, two indoor badminton courts/ table-tennis, basket-ball and volleyball courts and two extensive playgrounds for football, hockey, cricket with athletics and a beautiful swimming pool and a well equipped computer lab. The College is the premier and prestigious Institution of the City and as such can compare favourably with the best institutions not only in Uttar Pradesh, but in the country.<br/><br/>
The College aims at giving a value based wholesome quality education to develop along with intellectual excellence and achievement, the multi-faceted personality of the child as a moral and social being, with special emphasis to inculcate healthy moral values. Students are helped to become mature persons, imbibed with values to be worthy citizens of our country.<br/><br/>The institution had a very humble beginning. From the first two destitute children to the present strength of nearly two thousand students is a far cry, yet it is a proof of the sound foundation and enlightened leadership that this institution has been blessed with. It was on April 26th 1885 that Rev. Fr. Norbert, O.F.M. Cap., the then Parish Priest of St. Joseph’s Church, Hazratganj. [The present St. Joseph's Cathedral] took under his protection ISSAC and CHARLES CLAUDIUS and started teaching them himself. This posed to the good priest a serious problem but it was also a germ that produced an idea. Realizing that his congregation was in dire need of an educational institution for boys, he went about putting his plan into action. were few and those that existed catered mainly to the British, the then rulers of this country. From the pulpit and in his house to house visits to his parishioners, the enterprising priest spoke of his scheme and appealed for help. Without means and without funds he started St. Francis’ School and Orphanage. He knew no help would be forth coming from Government yet he severed.

                    In 1885, Rev. Fr. Norbert, O.F.M. Cap, of Tossignano began teaching two boys, Issac & Charles Claudius, on the verandah of the priest’s house. Realizing the pressing need of education, he established St. Francis School and orphanage. In 1890 he established St. Francis Boarding and Day School where the present Cathedral School exists. In 1908 the land where St. Francis School now stands was purchased by the Bishop of Allahabad Rt. Rev. Petronius Gramigna O.F.M. Cap, In 1918 St. Francis School was shifted to its present location on 8, Shahnajaf Road. St. Joseph’s Orphanage and St. Joseph’s High School continued on the same premises of St. Joseph’s Church.</p>

Aghast at what they term a “regressive, backward and outdated mindset”, the students decided to protest. “Be there or stay quiet forever”, said a poster which was put up on social media. Soon, some 100 students gathered at the ‘quadrangle’, a meeting point on campus, to speak their mind and express their disapproval of this “strict dress code” — salwar-kurtas or knee-length kurtis with sleeves that cover the elbows. “On one hand they claim they’re training us to become empowered women. But they forget that women have been oppressed for years, told what they can wear and cannot, and worse, judged on the basis of their clothing. This college is doing the same,” fumes a second year student. “They claim this dresscode is for our safety. But if we can’t even feel safe enough in a girl’s college without being asked to cover up all the time, will there ever be a safe space for women?” says another.</p>
